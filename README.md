# Wireless-Network-Management-with-Arduino

This assignment is part of the course Applications of Telecommunications Systems.The goal is to design and construct a centralised and distributed wireless sensor network which consists of four nodes.

Each wireless node consists of three parts: the sensor, the microcontroller and the transceiver. More specifically, the "brain" of the node is the Arduino Uno microcontroller board (based on the ATmega328 microcontroller). The wireless transceiver is the RFM22 shield that uses the re-programmable RFM22 module developed by "HOPERF". A small raster area is used for the needed sensors of the experiment. In addition, antennas are placed in each node.
